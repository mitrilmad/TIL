## git kraken problem
- issues about adding github remote to gitkraken
- `The GitHub.com option only comes into play after you have set the remote repo using the "URL" option. 
If there are multiple collaborators on a project and someone has created one or more forks of the project, then instead of "No Match" under the GitHub.com,
you would see a list of all the forks of the project on which you are a collaborator.
You could then add the forked repos as the 2nd, 3rd, etc. remotes, and any activity on those forks would be displayed to you on the commit graph.
This allows people to see what's going on in the forks,
and you can drag and drop from the forked parts of the graph to create pull requests to the repo you first set up using "URL".`
