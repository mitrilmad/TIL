# S3




## Security & Encryption

### Securing your buckets
- all newly created buckets are PRIVATE.
- access contorl by using Bucket Policies , Access Control Lists
- S3 bucket request log can be configured by another aws account or buckets

### Encryption
- In Transit;
  - SSL/TLS
- At Rest :
  - Server Side Encryption
    - S3 Managed Keys - SSE-S3 (each objects encrypted by strong multi factor encryption key - addtional safeguard - regular rotated key)
    - AWS Key Management Service, Managed Keys - SSE-KMS (separate envelop key, giving transparency)
    - Server Side Encryption with Customer Provided Keys - SSE-c

  - Client Side Encryption

### transfer acceleration
- Utilises the cloud-front edge network to accerate uploads to S3.
- Can use distinct URL to upload directly to an edge location which will then transfer that file to S3.
- Unlike data transfers using regional and global amazon S3 endpoints,  data transfers using Amazon S3 transfer acceleration will occur addional fee. (distinct url example : testbucket.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com)

### static website
- properties -> static website hosting (url ex : bucketname.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com)



## S3 Summary
- files can be from 0 Bytes to 5TB
- unlimited storage
- S3 is a universal namespace, must be unique globally
- url example :
  - origin url : https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bucketname
  - transfer acceleration url : https://bucketname.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com
  - static website hosting url : https://bucketname.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com
- consistency model :
  - read after write consistency for puts of new obejcts
  - eventual consistency for overrite puts and deletes
- S3 Storage Classes/Tiers
  - S3 (durable, immediately available, frequently accessed)
  - S3 - IA (durable, immediately available, infrequently accessed)
  - S3 - Reduced Redundancy Storage (easily reproducible , thumb nails)
  - Glacier - archived data , 3-5 hours before accessing

- S3 :
  - Key
  - value
  - Version ID
  - Metadata
  - Access Control Lists
  - Not suitable to install an operating system
  - all versions of an object (deleted object)
  - backup tool
  - Versioning can not be disabled, only suspended  (only way recreate bucket)
  - versioning s mfa delete capability - additional layer of security.
  - Cross Region Replication, requires versioning enabled on the source bucket
  - independent with versioning

## CloudFront
- origin - origin of all the files that the cdn will distribute. S3 Bucket , EC2 Instance, ELB , Route53
- distribution : consists of collection of edge locations
  - web distribution : for website
  - RTMP - for media streaming
- edge locations : not just READ only , write to them tool
- cached for the life of the TTL
- can clear cached objects, will be charged


**RRS 99.99 availability , 99.99 durability**
**big file upload by using multi-part upload**
